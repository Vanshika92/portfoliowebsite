      <h3>Location Based Blood Donation</h3>
      <p>To save others` lives it is necessary to locate the nearest available donor whose blood type matches the recipient's blood type. In order to interact with donors, a record of their information should be made so that anybody at the emergency location may communicate with them directly. We proposed a system that will assist in swiftly reaching the proper registered donor based on their current location and blood type. Finally, a GPS based android application was developed to facilitate the communication between the donors and the requester.</p>
